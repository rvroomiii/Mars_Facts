# Mission-to-Mars
## The purpose of this activity was to practice our skills of scraping and presenting data from websites.  The project consisted of two deliverables:
* Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.  
* Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.


# Summary
## This was an interesting project that combined our pandas skills with html/css knowledge.  I never considered the various ways information can be pulled and assembled from public websites.  With a little more practice, it is easy to see how beneficial these skills will be.
